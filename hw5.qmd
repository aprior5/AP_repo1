## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
gss_cat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(tvhours,partyid)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
#| label: Making a change

gss_cat_dem <- gss_cat %>% 
  filter(partyid != "Ind,near rep"|
           partyid != "Not str republican" |
           partyid != "Strong republican")

```
